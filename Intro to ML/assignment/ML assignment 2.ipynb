    "\n",
    "**How It Prevents Overfitting**:\n",

    "**Common Regularization Techniques**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**:\n",
    "    - **Description**: L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "    - **Mathematical Form**: `L1_penalty = λ * Σ|w_i|`\n",
    "    - **Effect**: Encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients to zero. It effectively performs feature selection by reducing less important features to zero.\n",
